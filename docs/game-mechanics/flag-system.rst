Flag System
-----------

The flag system is used to track various YES or NO decisions within the game for each
player. This includes information on the :doc:`kit-factions`, the minimap, ingame objects
that the player interacted with, the last VE-mission and more.

The flags are stored into a 12008 bit number as taskmask. Because there is no numberic datatype,
which can hold up to 12008 bits, the taskmask is split up into tiny parts, each 64 bits.

Each flag is configured using the :doc:`../database/PlayerFlags` table.

Derived Flag Numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flag ids used for binoculars and story plaques is generally
derived from the current zone ID and an additional index:

800+ID
    | The player has tamed the pet with Pet Component #ID
ZZNN
    | The player has looked through binocular NN on zones ZZâ€¦
    | Source: :script:`02_client/map/general/l_binoculars_client.lua`
10000+Z+N
    | The player has read story plaque N in zone Z
    | Source: :script:`02_client/map/general/l_story_box_interact_client.lua`
