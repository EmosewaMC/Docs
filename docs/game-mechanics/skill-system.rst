Skill / Behavior System
=======================

When an object in the game has a :doc:`../components/009-skill` attached, it has one or more
skills attached to it, which it can trigger. A skill is the root of a tree of behaviors that
get executed once the skill is triggered.

In the case of an attack by a player, these skills are executed on the client and the synchronized
to the server. The server may then interpret what the client has done (and possibly sanity-check it)
and execute any server side consequences of the attack. This includes updating the health of enemies
for all players and smashing an object once it has been killed.

For enemies, the Combat AI triggers the skill and as such the server must execute it. That information
is then synchronized to the clients for display.

Handling a behavior
-------------------

When a skill is triggered on the client, it will send a :gm:server:`StartSkill` message. This message
contains a bitstream that represents all the decisions the client has made whenever a behavior has
multiple paths to continue. An example for this would be the :doc:`behaviors/aoe` which will serialize
the amount of objects within the area, and then the object id and remaining bitstream for all of
these objects.

When a behavior is not completed immediately, it will serialize a :samp:`handleID`, which will then
later be used to identify a :gm:server:`SyncSkill` message that serializes the continued execution. It
is possible that this happens multiple times for a single skill execution.

.. uml::

   @startuml
   Client -> Server: StartSkill
   Server -> Client: EchoStartSkill

   loop
       Client -> Server: SyncSkill
       Server -> Client: EchoSyncSkill
   end
   @enduml

Behavior Templates
------------------

Via the :doc:`../database/BehaviorTemplate` table, each behavior is assigned a template. This template
defines what the behavior does, what it serializes to the bit stream and which subsequent actions
will be triggered. These templates are parameterized via the :doc:`../database/BehaviorParameter` table.

The following is a list of (networked) behavior templates.
